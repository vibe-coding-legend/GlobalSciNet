GlobalSciNet

The Global Scientific Collaboration Network Powered by Blockchain and Open-Source AI

Overview
GlobalSciNet is an open-source, decentralized platform designed to enable scientists worldwide to connect, collaborate, and verify their credentials transparently and securely. The platform integrates upgradeable blockchain smart contracts for identity and verification, a modern social networking frontend, and a modular system of multilingual open-source language models to support research workflows across every country and language.

GlobalSciNet ensures trusted scientific collaboration by:

	•	Providing blockchain-verified scientist profiles with rich metadata.
 
	•	Integrating open-source language models from every country for translation, summarization, and Q&A.
	•	Continuously cleaning data using an AI algorithm inspired by the golden ratio to maintain content integrity.
 
	•	Enabling plug-in architecture for automatic model updates and continuous training.
 
	•	Embedding ethical governance led by UNESCO to prohibit harmful research such as biological warfare.
 
	•	Offering a filtered, bias-free scientific newsfeed grounded in verified research findings.
 
	•	Following Toyota assembly line logic for efficient, modular, and quality-controlled development and deployment.

Key Features

1. Upgradeable Blockchain Smart Contract
   
	•	Built on Ethereum UUPS proxy pattern for seamless contract upgrades.

	•	On-chain roles and permissions managed via OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl.

	•	Stores verified scientist status and comprehensive profile data (name, institution, country, discipline, publications).

	•	Transparency via emitted events and blockchain data.

3. Dynamic Social Networking Frontend
   
	•	Wallet connection via MetaMask and ethers.js.

	•	Profile management linked to blockchain verification.

	•	Collaboration feeds and project management.

	•	Multi-language support with automatic translation and localization.

	•	Administrative dashboard for UNESCO coordinators.

6. Multilingual Open-Source Language Models
   
	•	Integration of over 120 languages with country- and region-specific AI models.
	•	Modular plug-in system allowing automatic model updates and version control.
	•	Continuous fine-tuning pipeline using clean, verified data.

8. AI Data Cleaning Algorithm
   
	•	Cleaning algorithm based on golden ratio logic combining confidence, similarity, and consistency metrics.

	•	Filters AI-generated noise (“slop”) and flags borderline cases for human review.

	•	Iteratively enhances data quality ensuring trustworthy research content.

10. Scientific News Aggregation and Curation
    
	•	Aggregates trusted scientific sources and journals.

	•	AI-powered bias and noise filtering to provide clean and evidence-based updates.

	•	Customizable user newsfeed with blockchain-backed transparency.

12. Ethical Governance and UNESCO Coordination
    
	•	UNESCO as key project coordinator ensuring ethical compliance and inclusive global partnership.

	•	Smart contract roles for UNESCO oversight on verifiers, upgrades, and ethical review.

	•	Platform policies strictly prohibiting biological warfare or harmful human research.

	•	Transparent reporting and community enforcement tools.

14. Toyota Assembly Line-Inspired Development Workflow
    
	•	Modular, just-in-time deployment and continuous improvement.

	•	Automated quality controls and balanced workload scheduling.

	•	Empowered teams with roles and transparent monitoring.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js and npm installed
 
	•	Hardhat for Ethereum development
 
	•	MetaMask browser extension for wallet interaction
 
	•	Access to Ethereum Sepolia testnet or your chosen network

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository 

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GlobalSciNet.git
cd GlobalSciNet (Bash)

2.	Install backend dependencies 

npm install (Bash)

3.	Set up your  .env  file with your Ethereum RPC URL and private key.
   
5.	Deploy the smart contract
